Hi there, I’m Rafael Milewski, a full-stack developer living in China for over a decade. I build all sorts of things, mostly with PHP and Rust, while also tinkering with hardware like ESP32 boards and contributing to open-source projects.

#### A few bytes about me:
- I use both `QWERTY` and `Colemak` keyboard layouts.
- People ask me which OS do I use? MacOS at work, NixOS at home, Windows on weekends.
- I learned electronics to teach my children how to build their own toys.
- I collect breakout boards as if they were collectables. Gotta Catch 'Em All!.

#### My current stack is:
- for backend: `PHP` `Laravel` `Laravel Nova` `Filament CMS`
- for frontend: `Vue` `Svelte` `React` `TypeScript` `ThreeJs`
- for infra: `Docker Swarm` `Traefik` `Terraform` `Ansible` `Caddy` `GitHub Actions` `(Aliyun / AWS / Vultr)`
- for IoT: `ESP32` `ESP-IDF` `ESP32C3/S3` `APIO` `Raspberry Pi`
- for AI: `ComfyUI` `Candle` `Burn` `Ollama`
- for design: `Photoshop` `Illustrator` `InDesign` `Figma` `After Effects`

#### Hobbies
- I love tinkering with hardware! Whenever I’m bored, I grab a random breakout board and write a driver for it.
- I enjoy discovering music in languages I don't speak. Sometimes I hit the jackpot:

#### Skills I'm Looking to Master
- Verilog: I’ve bought a few FPGA boards, and writing hardware code is fascinating!
- WebAssembly: Still searching for the perfect project to apply my Wasm knowledge.
- AI development: Current frameworks make it simple, but I want to go beyond them.
